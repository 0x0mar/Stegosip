This program is a part of thesis project with Professor Luigi Ciminiera of Politecnico di Torino.

StegoSIP allocates a point-to-point IP tunnel between two hosts, hiding traffic into SIP/RTP protocol with LSB/LACK steganographic methods. This software is currently under heavy development.

= Download ad Install =
In an Ubuntu/Debian Linux, first install libraries 

   $ sudo apt-get install nfqueue-bindings-python python-dpkt

Download code n both tunnel endpoints PC-Alice and PC-Bob. Then,
assign different tunnel IP addresses to PC-Alice and PC-Bob

   pc-alice$ gedit stegosip.conf        # set Alice IP option address as 10.0.0.1
   pc-bob$ gedit stegosip.conf        # set Bob IP address as 10.0.0.2

= Create steganographic tunnel = 

Start StegoSIP in Alice and Bob hosts

   pc-alice$ sudo ./stegosip.py
   pc-bob$ sudo ./stegosip.py

Stegosip automatically wait for incoming or ougoing SIP call. When it detect a RTP stream establishment, initialize in both endpoint stego0 tunnel interface to permit steganographic communication.

= Example =
Alice and Bob can run their favourite SIP phone (tested with ekiga) and make their calls. StegoSIP intercept outgoing RTP connection and start a stego0 interface, that you can use to communicate with other endpoint. Typical StegoSIP output (with comments):

   pc-alice$ sudo ./stegosip.py

   # Load filter to incercept incoming and outgoing SIP calls
   [SIP] added dissector and netfilter rules on udp 5060 ports.
   # Outgoing-call between alice and bob intercepted 
   [SIP] [OUTGOING-CALL:647604] alice@192.168.1.3->bob@192.168.1.4 [ local: INVITE ] 
   [SIP] [OUTGOING-CALL-ESTABILISHED:647604] alice@192.168.1.3->bob@192.168.1.4 [ remote:200 OK ] 
   # Extract RTP port and other parameters from collected SDP
   [SDP] local: 192.168.1.3:5072 remote:192.168.1.4:5076 
   # Load filter to intercept RTP connection
   [RTP] added dissector and netfilter rules on udp 5072<->5076 ports.
   # Starting stego0 interface with ip 10.0.0.1
   [TUN] Started Interface stego0 up 10.0.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 mtu 1392
   # Module to inject and extract data from tunnel loaded.
   [RTP] Injector 'LACK' module loaded

From now, alice e bob can communicate using 10.0.0.1 and 10.0.0.2 hosts.

   pc-alice$ ping 10.0.0.2

   PING 10.0.0.2 (10.0.0.2) 56(84) bytes of data.
   64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_req=1 ttl=64 time=50.1 ms
